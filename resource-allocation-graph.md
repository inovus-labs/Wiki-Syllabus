# Resource Allocation Graph

The resource allocation graph is the pictorial representation of the state of a system. As its name suggests, the resource allocation graph is the complete information about all the processes which are holding some resources or waiting for some resources. It also contains information about all the instances of all the resources whether they are available or being used by the processes. In the Resource allocation graph, the process is represented by a Circle while the Resource is represented by a rectangle.
